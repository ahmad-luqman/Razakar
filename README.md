## How we built it
Razakar mobile app is built with Xamarin and C# programming language with ease of building mobile apps for multiple mobile platforms (Android & iOS). Backend Razakar is being implemented in ASP.Net Core and SQL server hosted on Azure. We also own the domain (http://razakar.org/) and plan to develop a web app in angular too.

## How to run the code
This code assumes any Xamarin supported IDE e.g, Visual Studio 2017/Visual Studio Mac. Currently it requires a telerik Xamarin Forms controls which is a licensed library. We are planning to remove this dependency. Backend Moile Web API is implemented in ASP.Net core 2.1.
